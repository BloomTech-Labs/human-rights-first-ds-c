# Human Rights First DS C

You can find the deployed project at [Human Rights First Police Use-of-Force Dashboard](https://c.humanrightsfirst.dev/).

# Description

The Human Rights First Organization is a US-based nonprofit, nonpartisan organization concerned with international human rights. At its forefront, American ideals, universal values. For nearly 40 years, HRF has Challenged the status quo highlighting the global struggle for human rights and stepping in to demand reform accountability and justice. Given four weeks, create a full functioning Stack web application capable of visually demonstrating valid, current, and the uniquely reported incidence of police use of force within the United States. The information will help users, such as journalists and passersby, formulate their perspectives on current matters. The exemplary user interface immediately captures attention with the clusters of incidence shown by Geotagging. Investigate A creative methodology to eliminate excessive duplicates of data that maintains optimal storage capacity.

# Getting Started

### User Flows

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/o5cudR3w/team-c-labs28)

Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for Human Rights First, an independent advocacy and action organization.

We're pulling data from similiar APIs(All locations V2 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020PB/police-brutality/data_build/all-locations-v2.json, 846- https://api.846policebrutality.com/api/incidents) and from Twitter and Reddit. We want to identify aggregate these instances.

### Key Features

- User can browse incident map
- User can view specific instances with original source links
- User can view map with various filters

### Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  DBURLS  - Postgres database credentials
    *  API URL - API url responsible for updating the database


### Content Licenses

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nopic.yet      | INSERT NAME      | [MIT](input githandle here)                             |
### Installation Instructions

We used Docker for ease of use when dealing with environmental dependancies 

### Scripts

    Get AWS credentials
    
    Get your AWS access keys
    
    Install AWS Command Line Interface
    
    * aws configure -> configures AWS CLI
    * pip install pipx -> installs pipx
    * pipx install awsebcli -> installs AWS Elastic BeanStalk CLI
    
    Follow AWS EB docs: Use Docker to build the image locally, test it locally, then push it to Docker Hub
    
    * docker build -f project/Dockerfile -t YOUR-DOCKER-HUB-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME ./project 
    * docker login 
    * docker push YOUR-DOCKER-HUB-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME 
    
    Edit the image name in Dockerrun.aws.json then replace YOUR-DOCKER-HUB-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME with your values
    
    Then use the EB CLI:
    
    * git add --all 
    * git commit -m "Your commit message" 
    * eb init -p docker YOUR-APP-NAME --region us-east-1 
    * eb create YOUR-APP-NAME 
    * eb open 
    
    Then use AWS Route 53 to set up a domain name with HTTPS for your DS API
    
    Redeploy:
    
    * git commit ... 
    * docker build ... 
    * docker push ... 
    * eb deploy 
    * eb open 

# Tech Stack

### Data Science API built using:

- Python
- Docker
- FastAPI
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- PostgreSQL

### Why we made our tech stack decisions:

- Wanted to gain insight to AWS
- Docker makes environments easier
- FastAPI has been gaining traction over Flask
- SQL queries are better structured 

### Libraries used:

- Pandas
- Seaborn
- spacy
- nltk
- PRAW
- Plotly
- spacy
- newspaper3k
- psycopg2

# User Flow

### Data Science API

We are sending json objects to the backend with information about instances of police use of force. This information includes location data (city, state, and latitude and longitude) and relevant details about the incident, like the type of force that was used.

# Architecture
![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lambda-School-Labs/human-rights-first-ds-c/main/flowchart%20draft.png)

Get and clean data from source(s). Insert processed data into the database. Data Science API recieve GET request from back end API. Send the data to the back end API for new information to be added to web database. The front end requests data from the back end and that data is serve to the map component and the dashboard. If use requests to sign-up/login, user is sent to the OKTA Identity Provider for authentification.   


# Updates To Repo in Labs 28
* Using a database instead of a .csv file
* Added classification features based on associated tag words

# End Points
/getdata: Shows all the data in the database.

/getdata?date_added=yyyy-mm-dd: Optional parameter, to filter data from the given date(yyyy-mm-dd) and onward. For example, /getdata?date_added=2020-11-19.

# Issues
* A system neeeds to be implemented for input validations and testing. 
* The automatic 24-hour update needs to be activated and tested for new data.

**If you are having an issue with the existing project code, please submit a bug report under the following guidelines:**

- Check first to see if your issue has already been reported.
- Check to see if the issue has recently been fixed by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest master branch in the repository.
- Create a live example of the problem.
- Submit a detailed bug report including your environment & browser, steps to reproduce the issue, actual and expected outcomes, where you believe the issue is originating from, and any potential solutions you have considered.

# Future Features
* A filter on the dashboard to distinguish public approval of police use of force using NLP to create a sentiment analysis.
* Add a predict route to receive input data from a user to classify a type of use of force, as defined by the [National Institute of Justice: Police Use-of-Force Continuum](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/use-force-continuum). 
*
