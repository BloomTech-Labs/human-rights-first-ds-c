## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/QWXanExQ/team-c-2009)

[Product Canvas](https://whimsical.com/8sQcpjw3K2XdAiM9aeMkft)

Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for Human Rights First, an independent advocacy and action organization.

We're pulling data from similiar APIs(All locations V2 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020PB/police-brutality/data_build/all-locations-v2.json, 846- https://api.846policebrutality.com/api/incidents) and from Twitter and Reddit. We want to identify aggregate these instances.

### Key Features

- User can browse incident map
- User can view specific instances with original source links
- User can view map with various filters

## Tech Stack

### Data Science API built using:

- Python
- Docker
- FastAPI
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Why we made our tech stack decisions:

- Wanted to gain insight to AWS
- Docker makes environments easier
- FastAPI has been gaining traction over Flask

### Libraries used:

- Pandas
- Seaborn
- spacy
- nltk
- PRAW
- Plotly
- spacy
- newspaper3k

#### Data Science API deployed to AWS

# APIs

## Data Science API

We are sending json objects to the backend with information about instances of police use of force. This information includes location data (city, state, and geocode) and relevant details about the incident, like the type of force that was used.

## PRAW

PRAW, The Python Reddit API Wrapper, makes it easy for users to analyze Reddit data. We used PRAW to scrape Reddit for potential instances of police of force.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  PRAW_CLIENT_ID  - keys for Reddit API
    *  PRAW_CLIENT_SECRET - keys for Reddit API
    *  PRAW_USER_AGENT - keys for Reddit API

# Testing

We tested the classifier on sets of 100-1000 incidents at a time, our aim was in precision as to minimize false incidents included. 

# Installation Instructions

We used Docker for ease of use when dealing with environmental dependancies 

## Scripts

    Get AWS credentials
    
    Get your AWS access keys
    
    Install AWS Command Line Interface
    
    * aws configure -> configures AWS CLI
    * pip install pipx -> installs pipx
    * pipx install awsebcli -> installs AWS Elastic BeanStalk CLI
    
    Follow AWS EB docs: Use Docker to build the image locally, test it locally, then push it to Docker Hub
    
    * docker build -f project/Dockerfile -t YOUR-DOCKER-HUB-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME ./project 
    * docker login 
    * docker push YOUR-DOCKER-HUB-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME 
    
    Edit the image name in Dockerrun.aws.json then replace YOUR-DOCKER-HUB-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME with your values
    
    Then use the EB CLI:
    
    * git add --all 
    * git commit -m "Your commit message" 
    * eb init -p docker YOUR-APP-NAME --region us-east-1 
    * eb create YOUR-APP-NAME 
    * eb open 
    
    Then use AWS Route 53 to set up a domain name with HTTPS for your DS API
    
    Redeploy:
    
    * git commit ... 
    * docker build ... 
    * docker push ... 
    * eb deploy 
    * eb open
